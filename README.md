# 🚚 Moved to Codeberg

All repositories have moved to:
**[codeberg.org/GERBER-MEDIA](https://codeberg.org/GERBER-MEDIA)**

With political unpredictability becoming the norm in the US,
I've chosen to trust European infrastructure for my work.

Codeberg e.V. is a non-profit based in Germany —
open source, community-driven, no VC money, no US jurisdiction.

**This repository is no longer maintained here.**
